# Process Hollowing
Process hollowing is technique to hide malware inside other programs but it works for game enhancers aswell

## Usage
1. Clone the repo based on your executables architecture
2. Turn your executable into shellcode using the provided converter
3. Paste it into `shellcode.h`
4. Set the path in `main.cpp` to your desired process
5. Compile in `Release | x64`

## Need help?
Contact me through Discord [here](https://hellokittyfan48.github.io/)

### Note
- Subsystems of both executables should be matching
- I can't be bothered to merge the 2 architectures, if you feel like doing it open a pull request
- This is for EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY and shouldn't be used to inject MALICIOUS code into legitimate processes
